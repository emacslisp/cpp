 * checking etc), and means less interrupt jumping in case of errors,
 * so the code is hopefully easier to understand.
 */

/*
 * This file is certainly a mess. I've tried my best to get it working,
 * but I don't like programming floppies, and I have only one anyway.
 * Urgel. I should check for more errors, and do more graceful error
 * recovery. Seems there are problems with several drives. I've tried to
 * correct them. No promises.
 */

/*
 * As with hd.c, all routines within this file can (and will) be called
 * by interrupts, so extreme caution is needed. A hardware interrupt
 * handler may not sleep, or a kernel panic will happen. Thus I cannot
 * call "floppy-on" directly, but have to set a special timer interrupt
 * etc.
 *
 * Also, I'm not certain this works on more than 1 floppy. Bugs may
 * abund.
